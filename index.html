          <p>Hello! I am Shreya, a Software Engineer at Meta I am working for Facebook Search Integrity, building systems that curb the prevalence of very harmful content on the site. 
          Before this, I was a master's student at School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. During my master's, I completed a summer internship at Meta as a Backend Software Engineer.
           At Meta, I was part of the storage team building second-generation of blob storage for providing our clients with more flexibility in terms of assigning a storage policy. In particular, I built a C++ service for the automated generation and management
            of storage volumes. </p>
          <p>
            My research interests primarily focus on secure systems that allow multiple parties to perform
          decentralised computation without much overhead. I'm currently working secure ML interference with Prof Wenting Zheng. </p>
          
          <p> In the summer prior to my master's, I worked as a software engineer for the Bing UX Team
             at Microsoft India. My tasks at Bing mainly included - bug fixing and incorporating feedback to the recently launched
        <a href="https://www.bing.com/travel">TravelHub</a>. For my Bachelorâ€™s Thesis, I collaborated with
          <a href="https://www.encrypto.cs.tu-darmstadt.de/research_profile/index.en.jsp">
          ENCRYPTO Group</a> at TU Darmstadt to build a framework for secure
          multi-party computation (MPC) called <a href="https://github.com/Oleksandr-Tkachenko/MOTION">MOTION</a>.
          We've used various technologies and design decisions to build MOTION in a user-friendly and extensible manner,
          and I hope that it promotes adoption of MPC protocols in practice.</p>
          
          <p>In 2019, I interned at NTU Singapore to work on collaborative Deep Learning (DL). My research involved designing
          efficient protocols for federated learning on DL models while strengthening the security guarantees involved. Previously, I also worked with <a href="http://www.eng.biu.ac.il/hazay/">
          Dr Carmit Hazay</a> at Bar Ilan University,
          Israel to come up with mathematical constructs that make way for simpler protocols in MPC.</p>
